    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
            I have been serving Sellers, Buyers, Landlords and Tenants (including corporate tenant) in District 03, 05, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20, 21, 22 with main focus on District 10 and 11. I'm involved in resale and rental of Private Residential and HDB. My motto at work: ‘Serve with integrity, sincerity and always put client’s interest as top priority!’ <br>
<br>
            My achievement come from the satisfaction my clients have with their properties serviced by me and the referrals I get from them. It is a privilege to extend my services to their relatives and friends as well. <br>     
<br>
            If you are looking for an agent, I sincerely hope to have an opportunity to meet up and discuss your property needs. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.
